# Overview of Project
## Frontend
This website simplifies task organization with features to add, edit, delete, and categorize tasks, plus options for searching, filtering, and drag-and-drop reordering. Creative elements like a progress bar, calendar view, and dark mode enhance usability. Built with TypeScript for robust code and React Context or Redux for efficient state management, it ensures seamless data handling via a mock backend or custom API. The platform combines functionality and user-friendly design to deliver a comprehensive task management solution, with potential for future enhancements like gamification or external tool integration.

## Backend
The backend leverage Firebase to provide seamless data management and integration. Firebase's real-time database and Firestore will handle CRUD functionality for tasks, ensuring efficient creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. Firebase eliminates the need for setting up a custom server, streamlining development with its ready-to-use cloud-based solutions. This approach guarantees scalability, real-time updates, and smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.
